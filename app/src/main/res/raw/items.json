the Sombrero Galaxy or M104, is a spiral galaxy in Virgo, famous for its bright nucleus, large central bulge, and prominent dust lane. The galaxy resembles a sombrero hat, hence its name. It's visible in small telescopes as an elongated feature with a bright core. Larger telescopes, particularly over 8 inches, can reveal the dark dust lane that bisects the galaxy. A magnification of 100x to 150x is ideal for observing the details of the Sombrero Galaxy, especially the contrast between its bright core and the dark lane.","id":0,"recommended":false,"tags":""},{"friendlyName":"NGC 4833","objectId":"c105","ngcId":"NGC 4833","ra":194.9,"dec":-70.8833333333,"type":"cluster","subType":"Globular Cluster","constellation":"Musca","magnitude":7.3,"observationNotes":null,"id":0,"recommended":false,"tags":""},{"friendlyName":"47 Tuc Cluster","objectId":"c106","ngcId":"NGC 104","ra":6.025,"dec":-72.0833333333,"type":"cluster","subType":"Globular Cluster","constellation":"Tucana","magnitude":4.0,"observationNotes":null,"id":0,"recommended":false,"tags":""},{"friendlyName":"NGC 6101","objectId":"c107","ngcId":"NGC 6101","ra":246.45,"dec":-72.2,"type":"cluster","subType":"Globular Cluster","constellation":"Apus","magnitude":9.3,"observationNotes":null,"id":0,"recommended":false,"tags":""},{"friendlyName":"NGC 4372","objectId":"c108","ngcId":"NGC 4372","ra":186.45,"dec":-72.6666666667,"type":"cluster","subType":"Globular Cluster","constellation":"Musca","magnitude":7.8,"observationNotes":null,"id":0,"recommended":false,"tags":""},{"friendlyName":"NGC 3195","objectId":"c109","ngcId":"NGC 3195","ra":152.375,"dec":-80.8666666667,"type":"nebula","subType":"Planetary Nebula","constellation":"Chamaeleon","magnitude":null,"observationNotes":null,"id":0,"recommended":false,"tags":""}]
